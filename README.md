# Airlines Data Analysis ðŸ›«ðŸ“Š

## Project Overview

- **Project Name:** Airlines Data Analysis
- **Created by:** Prakhar Tripathi and Ishita Mistra
- **Description:** This data analysis project is conducted using MySQL and Python to solve a business problem within the airline industry. The goal is to find insights to address the challenges faced by the company.

### Business Problem

- The airline company operates a diverse fleet facing challenges like stricter environmental regulations, higher flight taxes, increased interest rates, rising fuel prices, and a tight labor market leading to increased labor costs.
- **Objective:** To increase occupancy rates and average profit earned per seat.

## Project Structure

The project structure revolves around exploring the database, performing analysis, and deriving insights. Here's a glimpse of the steps followed:

### Data Exploration

- **Tables Explored:** aircrafts_data, airports_data, boarding_passes, bookings, flights, seats, ticket_flights, tickets
- **Clean Data:** No missing values observed.

### Basic Analysis

- **Questions Explored:**
  - Number of Planes with more than 100 seats.
  - Total number of tickets booked and total revenue earned over time.
  - Average charges for each aircraft based on fare conditions.
  - Analysis of occupancy rates per aircraft.

### Insights and Visualizations

- The analysis includes visualizations depicting:
  - Average revenue per ticket for each aircraft based on fare conditions.
  - Occupancy rates and potential increase in annual turnover with a 10% higher rate.
  - Flight statuses, cancellation counts, and fare conditions used most frequently.
  - Monthly and daily booking amounts.

## Code Structure

The Python script follows a structured approach:
- Importing required libraries for analysis and visualization.
- Database connection and exploration of tables.
- Performing basic analysis and answering business questions.
- Visualizations using matplotlib and seaborn.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure the required dependencies are installed.
3. Configure the database path in the script.
4. Run the Python script to perform analysis.

## Future Enhancements

- Explore additional metrics for customer satisfaction.
- Implement predictive modeling for flight occupancy.
